Paws and Paychecks FULL BLUEPRINT

You are an expert full-stack game developer. Build a complete, interactive virtual pet + financial literacy game called Paws and Paychecks, following this blueprint exactly.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

Game lasts 12 in-game weeks.

Player adopts a pet and manages:

Pet health (0–100)

Pet happiness (0–100)

Player wallet/balance

Each week, the player:

Plays a unique, interactive minigame tied to their job (performance determines weekly income)

Spends money on pet needs

Faces a random financial event

Include short delays between rounds (~1–2 seconds) to improve pacing.

Dynamic pet visuals: appearance changes depending on health and happiness.

UI colors dynamically reflect stats while keeping the base scheme:

Negative wallet → red highlights

Low health/happiness → subtle warnings or color changes

Positive stats → normal or green accents

HOME SCREEN

Welcome player by name (persistent).

Pet name changes each game.

Options:

Start Game

Trophy Bookshelf (tracks past games)

Settings / Help

Trophy rules:

No trophy if bankrupt or pet health/happiness < 50

Bronze → Silver → Gold based on weekly and overall performance

Hard Mode: thresholds lowered

Platinum trophy for exceptional Hard Mode performance

JOB & SALARY SYSTEM

Player takes a 5-question Job Aptitude Quiz at start.

Quiz determines:

Job type

Weekly salary

Jobs affect:

Minigame type

Difficulty of financial management

Income scaling

Example jobs and corresponding minigames:

Job	Minigame Example	Skill Tested	Reward Scaling
Office	Typing/logic puzzle	Accuracy & speed	Faster completion → higher income
Chef	Ingredient sorting / recipe challenge	Precision & timing	Correct combos → higher income
Engineer	Circuit connection puzzle	Problem solving	Fewer mistakes → higher income
Teacher	Quiz grading / matching	Attention to detail	More correct → higher income
Artist	Color matching / drawing prompt	Creativity & speed	Better completion → higher income

Each minigame must be interactive, visually engaging, and different each week.

FINANCIAL MECHANICS

Wallet balance: tracks income minus expenses.

Expenses include:

Food

Housing/Upkeep

Healthcare

Toys (happiness buffer)

Random weekly events using weighted probability:

Example Event Table:

Event Name	Effect	Probability
Vet emergency	-20 to -50 balance, -5 health	10%
Broken toy replacement	-10 to -20 balance	15%
Work bonus	+20 to +50 balance	10%
Unexpected tax refund	+10 to +30 balance	5%
Minor illness	-5 health, -5 happiness	10%
Gift from friend	+5 happiness	10%
Normal week (no event)	None	40%

Events should show dynamic pop-ups or modals and update pet and wallet stats accordingly.

PET SYSTEM

Stats: Health (0–100), Happiness (0–100)

Visual changes based on stats:

Health < 50 → pet looks sick/weak

Happiness < 50 → pet looks sad

Health & Happiness ≥ 80 → pet looks energetic/happy

Stats change from:

Purchases (food, toys, healthcare)

Neglect (skipping care)

Random events

Include animations or visual indicators when stats change.

UI REQUIREMENTS

Dashboard shows:

Wallet balance

Pet portrait & stats

Week counter

Dynamic UI feedback:

Negative wallet → red highlights/warnings

Low health/happiness → yellow or orange accents

High stats → green/neutral accents

Modals/dialogs for:

Minigames

Events

Spending choices

Trophy viewing

Keep base color scheme consistent but adapt to current game state visually.

TROPHY SYSTEM

Week 12 summary screen includes:

Total income

Total spending

Financial efficiency score

Pet health & happiness score

Trophy rules:

Bronze: moderate performance (balanced stats, some income saved)

Silver: good performance (high stats, decent savings)

Gold: excellent performance (high stats + large savings)

Platinum: Hard Mode + exceptional performance

Scaling formulas for trophies (suggested):

Base Score = (Total Income / Max Possible Income)*40 
           + (Avg Pet Health / 100)*30 
           + (Avg Pet Happiness / 100)*30

Bronze >= 50  
Silver >= 70  
Gold >= 85  
Platinum (Hard Mode) >= 95

GAME FLOW & PACE

Each round/week:

Display home screen / status

Run weekly minigame

Apply income based on minigame performance

Apply random event effects

Update pet visuals dynamically

Show updated dashboard / short delay (~1–2 seconds)

Repeat for 12 weeks
